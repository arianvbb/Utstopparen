This was the 3rd evaluation of my month of training which was done after two week into the process. This was most definetely my most impressive piece of work in C++ thus far and what I'm most proud of. I've properly documented code, clean architecture and i use complicated C++ concepts to realize the idea.  It's a pretty basic UI and the magic lies in the backend, the logic in the source code. This code is a statistics library which let's you analyze and get key numbers on your data.

## ❇️Features
- **Templates**: Templates allow for different datatypes to be assigned our vectors, primarily float, double and int as other datatypes wouldn't allow for a lot of the calculations the program does.
- **Fstream**: We use this to read the CSV file and actually extract data, I used a pretty difficult approach which was the only one I could think of to allow the user to only work with one of the rows as the user desires.
- **Data analysis**: I have a plethora of options to look at data, the program can calculate the mean, mode, variance, median, et cetera. 
- **Dynamic availability**: As with most of my programs it's a program that can adapt to the size of your CSV file and is perfectly scalable without you having to make any changes apart from the file name in the code.

#### This project was made entirely in C++ with these following libraries: iostream, vector, algorithm, map, fstream, cmath, string

## 🤔The Process 

I realized at the very beginning I would make a simple UI and have all the calculations be done in their own functions, however something I didn't realize was that the start was suprisingly easy. The difficult part was optimizing the code and setting up more difficult calculations, like with the median function I need to pass the vector as an argument by value and not reference so I could sort it and go to the middle. I also realized the process of allowing the user to select a row was super difficult, mainly because I didn't know any easy way to do it. So my solution was improvised and a little rough but fully functional.

## 📚My takeaways

My first time using templates properly and it was very educational. I also developed a deeper understanding of syntax and concepts as passing my reference, const or not, et cetera.

I also learnt something which I kinda new, I just realized it, a simple architecture is key for a project with a timelimit. Make a super basic working prototype and then improve it.


## 🚀Running the project 

1. Install the StatisticsLibrary.cpp file alongside C++ on your code editor.
2. Open the cpp file and change the already placed csv file name to a file of your choice.
3. Run your code.
